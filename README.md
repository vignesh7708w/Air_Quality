# Air_Quality

1)Implementing the Air_Quality checking website using the API
2)Techlogies:HTML,CSS,Javascript,JSON
3)I used the third party API for to fetch the air quality data

API URL:https://rapidapi.com/Timoxz/api/air-quality-api/

#Implementation

1)I created HTML page for the users inorder to search their own city manually
2)After entered the data the particular data will be reflected into the javascript code and it will fetch the data from the API and convert into JSON format
3)Based on the needs we can manipulate the DOM and selected details will be shown in the website
4)The user may check the same city for to avoid the repeaded searching for data I implemented the cache for to store the duplicate data for some duration
5)The user may enter the number also for to avoid that I implemented the intial check whether the entered data is valid or not.
